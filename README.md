Developed in C using standard input-output libraries, this hotel ordering system utilizes structured data and control flow logic to manage menu interactions and billing through a command-line interface. The program is built around arrays or structs to store menu items and prices, employing loops and conditional statements to process user selections and maintain an active tally of the order. By leveraging C’s efficiency in memory management and console-based interaction, the system executes real-time calculations to generate an itemized bill, demonstrating how foundational programming concepts like pointers and formatted output can be applied to create a reliable, service-oriented utility.
